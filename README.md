## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Create environment file: `cp .env.example .env`
4. Configure your API settings in `.env`:
```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.vatcomply.com
VITE_CACHE_EXPIRE_MINUTES=5
```
5. Start development server: `npm run dev`

## API Configuration

This application supports multiple exchange rate APIs:

1. **VATComply** (default): Free API with EUR as base currency
2. **fxratesapi.com**: Requires API key (set `VITE_API_KEY` in .env)

## Architecture Decisions

- **State Management**: React hooks with localStorage persistence
- **Caching Strategy**: 5-minute cache expiration with background refresh
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries and user feedback
- **Performance**: React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback for optimization
- **Offline Support**: Service Workers and cached API responses
